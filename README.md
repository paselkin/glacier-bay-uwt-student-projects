## Prerequisites

To prepare to use the software and data in this folder, you will need to install the following:
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) - This distribution of the Python programming language comes with most of the packages (like plugins in other software) you will need. Use the free version, since you are not using it for commercial work.
- Also install the following packages using `conda install _package_name_`:
  - Altair: [altair](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/altair) - Data visualization package, like ggplot in R
  - Altair Data Server: [altair_data_server](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/altair_data_server) - For visualizing large datasets
- Follow the instructions on the [PmagPy site](https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-docs/installation/PmagPy_install.html) to install the PmagPy package for processing paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data. *NOTE*: follow the detailed instructions under "You can find more specific pip install instructions" for your particular system. *Do not* just do the `pip install` stuff.
